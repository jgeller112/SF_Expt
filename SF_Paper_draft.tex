HEAD The primary goal of most humans is to remember the information they
lean. Decades of research have put forth the paradoxical idea that
making learning harder (not easier) should have the desirable effect of
improving long-term retention of material--called the desirable
diffuclty principle (Bjork, 1994). Notable examples of desirable
difficulties include having participants generate information from word
fragments instead of passively reading intact words (e.g., Slamecka \&
Graf, 1978), spacing out study sessions instead of massing them (e.g.,
Carpenter, 2017), and having participants engage in retrieval practice
after studying instead of simply restudying the information (Kornell \&
Vaughn, 2016). Another simple strategy that has gained some attention is
to make material more perceptually disfluent. This can be done by
changing the material's perceptual characteristics (Diemand-Yaumen,
Oppenheimer, \& Vaughan, 2011; French et al., 2013). Visual material
that is masked (Mulligan, ======= Stundents want to remmeber the

Friedman, \& Castel, 2011), presented in an atypical font (Diemand
Yaumen et al., 2011), blurred (Rosner, Davis, \& Milliken, 2015), or
even in handwritten cursive (Geller, Still, Dark, Carpenter, 2018) have
all been shown to produce memory benefits. The desirable effect of
perceptual disfluency on memory is called called the disfluency effect.

Although appealing as a pedagogical strategy, there have been several
experiments that failed to find memorial benefits for perceptually
disfluent materials (e.g., Magreehan, Serra, Schwartz \& Narciss, 2016;
Rhodes \& Castel, 2008, 2009; Rummer, Scheweppe, \& Schewede, 2016; Yue,
Castel, \& Bjork, 2013), casting doubt upon the veracity of the
disfluency effect. Recent studies by Geller et al.(2018) and Geller \&
Still (2018) found that perceptual disfluency can have a beneficial
effect on memory, but seems to be rather fickle, thus delimiting its
educational usefuleness.

\section{What do we know about SF?}\label{what-do-we-know-about-sf}}

There is not information about SF. The typyface itself is a variation of
a sans-serif typeface. It is a typeface that consists of intermitten
gaps in letters that are back slanted (see below picture). The design
features of this typeface require readers of it to ``fill-in'' the
missing pieces like a puzzle. As it pertains to the empirical validation
of the claims made, the website does offer some information about SF and
how the original results were obtained, but not enough information to
replicate the studies.

HEAD Earp (2018) conducted an interview with the creators of SF and here
is what we know. Apparently two studies were conducted. In a lab
experiment (\emph{N}=96), they had participants read 20 word pairs
(e.g., girl - guy; called a paried associates task in cognitive
parlance) in three new fonts (one of them being SF) and a typical or
common font. The font pairs were presented were counterbalanced across
participants. What this means is that all fonts were shown, but the same
pairs were never presneted in more than one type of font. Each word pair
was presnted on the screen for 100 ms (that is super fast\ldots{}). For
a final test, they were given the cue (e.g., \emph{girl}) and had to
respond with the target (\emph{guy}). What did they find? According to
the interview, targets were recalled 68\% of time when presented in a
common font. For cue-target pairs in SF, targets were recalled 69\% of
the time--a negeliable difference. ======= Earp (2018) conducted an

In an online experiment, participants were presented passages (250 words
in total) where one of the paragraphs was presented in SF. Each
participant saw five different texts in total. For each text they were
asked one question about the part written in SF and another question
about the part written in standard Arial. Participants remembered 57\%
of the text when a section was written in Sans Forgetica, compared to
50\% of the surrounding text that was written in a plain Arial font.

At the time of this writing, these studies have not been published nor
is there a preprint available. I reached out to the creators of SF, but
they refused to share the materials with me. Instead of waiting, I
elicited the help of Sara Davis and Daniel Peterson at Skidmore
university to test the mnenmomic benefits of Sans Forgetica. We
preregistered two studies (\url{https://osf.io/d2vy8/}). All materials,
data, and analysis scripts can be found at that website. On my github,
you can reproduce all analyses for the two reported experiments in an
online container (\url{https://github.com/jgeller112/SF_Expt1};

\hypertarget{experiment-1}{%
\section{Experiment 1}\label{experiment-1}}

In the first study we compared the mnenmonic benefits of SF against a
robust technique known to enhance memory---generation. The generation
effect is a phenomenon where information is better remembered when
retrieved than if it is simply read. In a prototypical
experiment,participants are asked to generate words from word fragments
DOLL - DR\_\_ or read intact cue-target pairs (\emph{DOLL-DRESS}).
Compared to the intact condition, individuals recall the generated
target words at a higher rate. The natural of generation is where the
power of SF comes from, according to the authors. We put that to the
test in the first experiment.

HEAD We preregistered a sample size of 230 participants (115 per group)
to detect a small-to medium size interaction effect (d = .35) with 90\%
power. We choose this effect size as our SESOI due in part due the small
effect sizes seen in actaul classroom studies (Bulter et al., 2014). We
recruited 230 people from Amazon's Mechanical Turk Service. We initially
collected data from 120 people, and then excluded participants who 1)
did not complete every phase of the experiment, 2) started the
experiment multiple times, 3) reported experiencing technical problems
did not indicate that they were fluent in English, or 5) reported seeing
our stimuli before.

In Experiment 1 we had 115 particpants in each condition (\emph{N} =
230). Data was collected using MTurk. We preregistered a sample size of
230 participants (115 per group) to detect a small-to medium size
interaction effect (d = .35) with 90\% power. We choose this effect size
as our SESOI due in part due the small effect sizes seen in actaul
classroom studies (Bulter et al., 2014).

In Experiment 1 participants were presented with 40 weakly
relatedcue-targte pairs. The pairs were nouns, 5--7 letters, 1--3
syllables in length, and high in concreteness (400--700) and frequency
(at least 30 per million). For half of the participants, half of the
targets were presented in SF while the other half were presented in
Arial font; for the other half of participants, the targets were
presented with missing letters (vowels were replaced by underscores) and
the other half were intact (Arial font). After a short 2 minute
distractor task (anagram generation), they completed a cued recall test.

Spell checking was automated with the hunspell package in R (Ooms, 2018)
using spellCheck.R. Becasuse participants were recruited in the United
States, we used the American English dictionary. A nice walkthrough on
how to use the package can be found in Buchcamam, De Deyne, \&
Montefinese (2019). Using the package, each response was corrected for
misspelings. Corrected spellings are provided in the most probable
order, therefore, the first suggestion is selected as the correct
answer. Answers were marked correct if they provided the exact response.

In order for a response to be judged correctly, the response had to
match the correct answer. Scoring was automated with the hunspell
package in R (Ooms, 2018). Using the package, each response was
corrected for misspelings. Becasuse participants were recruited in the
United States, we used the American English dictionary. A nice
walkthrough on how to use the package can be found in Buchcamam, De
Deyne, \& Montefinese (2019). The most probably response (the first
answer) was chosen as the correct spelling. What did we find?

In Experiment 1 we found a sizeable generation effect, which replicated
past work. However, we did not find a SF effect (See figure below)

HEAD Experiment 2 examined the SF in a more educatioanlly realistic
scenairo. We presented participants a passage on ground water where some
of the material was either: pre-highlighted, presented in SF, or
presneted with no changes. This was a between-subjects manipulation.
Specifically participants read a passage about ground water (856 words)
from the U.S. Geological Survey website (Yue, Storm, Kornell, Bjork,
2014). Eleven critical phrases \footnote{orginally we had 12 critical
  phrases but a pilot test after the pregreistation showed that one of
  the questions was repeated twice so we removed one of them and also
  added a manipulation check question to sure participants were paying
  attention} each containing a different keyword, were selected from the
passage (e.g., the term \emph{recharge} was the keyword in the phrase:
Water seeping down from the land surface adds to the ground water and is
called recharge water.) and were either presented in SF, highlighted, or
unchanged. Then, 11 fill-in-the blank questions were created from these
phrases by deleting the keyword and asking participants to provide it on
the final test (e.g., Water seeping down from the land surface adds to
the ground water and is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ water).

We found that infromation that was pre-hightlighted had better recall
than passages presentened normally. We did not find that passages in SF
were better remembered than normal or highligheted passages.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

The evidence contained herein suggests that SF does not have the
mnemonic effects pruported by its creators. Now it is possible that
there is an effect of SF, but the effect size might be smaller than we
could detect acorss our two studies. Our SESOI was d = .35. If so, it
probably does not have any real educational benefit. It is our
conclsuion that SF is really forgetable and you should not be using it
as a way to boost leanring.
